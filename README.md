# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

A simple visualizer of sorting algorithms using Java, with a very minimalistic Swing UI.
I implemented MVC architecture for the first time, i'm not really sure if i got it right 😅😅 .

# Algorithms Implemented:
  - Bubble sort
  - Selection sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Quick sort
  - Merge sort
  - Heap sort

Many more algorithms will be implemented in the future, hope so .
